# Practice Fusion Coding Challenge

## Total Time Spent
    - logic & coding: 4hrs
    - styling: 2hrs
    - datasource: 2hr
        - This was quite a hassle as I planned to use the better doctors API. After pulling in the data I noticed that the rating score for each doctor was blank, and all the cities were too unique to actually show the sorting of data in action. I eventually found [Json Generator](https://www.json-generator.com/)
